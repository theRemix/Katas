start with context:

no ego, not a competition, challenge yourself
- do something different, use new tools
- do your best, if you were doing a live whiteboarding exercise, how clean can you get your submission?
- min/max, can you optimize your algorithm for smallest space and time complexity?

engage with others
- utilize the community
- why did they choose to do it 'that' way
- ask for help
- give kudos!
